# Student Portal

## Project Summary

The Student Portal is a web application built using React.js that allows students to manage their academic information, view grades, and access course materials. The application is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for students to interact with their academic data.

## Description

This project is a comprehensive student management system that includes the following features:
- User authentication and authorization
- Dashboard displaying student information
- Course enrollment and management
- Grade viewing and tracking

The backend of the application is powered by Supabase, which provides a scalable and secure database solution.
